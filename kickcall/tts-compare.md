## üßÆ Cost Estimation for 1,000 Concurrent Users

**Assumptions:**
- Each user receives 1 TTS response every 15 seconds
- Each response averages 100 characters

**Calculations:**
- **Characters per minute per user:** (60 / 15) * 100 = 400 characters
- **Total characters per minute for 1,000 users:** 400 * 1,000 = 400,000 characters
- **Total characters per hour:** 400,000 * 60 = 24,000,000 characters

**Cost per Hour:**
- **Deepgram:** 24,000,000 characters / 1,000 * $0.030 = $720.00
- **ElevenLabs:** 1,000 users * $0.05 per minute * 60 minutes = $3,000.00
