## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### 1. **LiveKit Deployment with SIP Integration**

- **Self-Hosting*: Deploy LiveKit in a distributed setup using Docker Compose or Kubernetes for scalabiliy. citeturn0search7

- **SIP Configuration*: Set up the LiveKit SIP server to handle SIP signaling and media rely. citeturn0search2

- **Firewall Settings*: Ensure ports 5060 (SIP) and 10000–20000 (RTP) are open and properly routd.

### 2. **Deepgram STT (Nova-3) Integration**

- **Model Selection*: Use Nova-3 for its high accuracy in noisy environments and support for multiple languags. citeturn0search3

- **Self-Hosting*: Deploy Nova-3 models on-premises for data privacy and reduced lateny. citeturn0search8

- **Concurrency Handling*: Configure the system to manage up to 50 concurrent streaming requests, with options to scale as needd. citeturn0search10

### 3. **Deepgram TTS (Aura-2) Integration**
