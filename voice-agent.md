how can we achieve concurrency in voice agents backends using the LLMs , STT and TTS when handling multiple businesses and multiple users in each business . Currently we are using Livekit framework with Deepgram (STT) , openAI(LLM) and elevenlabs (TTS). We need to enable this concurrency for SIP as well. SIP enables internet-based calls, and AI makes those calls smarter by automating responses, analyzing conversations, and improving customer service. Together, they power modern voice assistants and call centers. We are trying to sell our framework as SAAS and whitelable solution and currently we are focused on handling inbound and outbound calls using these Voice agentic pipelines . Also we need to search the best optimal cost-effective solution and implement analytics to each call for further refinement of cost and performance .

Research and layout the step wise approach how to achieve and ask any missing pieces of imformation if you need more context 

Refer to below links and information and create a more detailed , smartly tailored logical plan to handle above with performance , cost and high concurrency

Based on the knowledge sources provided, I can explain which models can be hosted on a self-hosted Deepgram framework.
When setting up a self-hosted Deepgram deployment, you can host various models depending on your specific use cases. Your Deepgram Account Representative will provide you with a list of models suitable for your needs. Here's what the documentation indicates about model selection:
Available Models for Self-Hosting
You can host several types of models in your self-hosted Deepgram deployment:
Speech-to-Text (STT) Models - Including different architectures like Nova-3 and Nova-2
Text-to-Speech (TTS) Models - Such as Aura for voice synthesis
Language-specific models - Models with language codes like en (English) or es (Spanish)
Domain-specific models - Such as nova-3-medical or nova-2-phonecall
Feature-specific models - Models that support specific capabilities:
Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for smart formatting
phoneme and g2p models for Keywords functionality (with Nova-2)
sit model for sentiment analysis, intent recognition, and topic detection
language-detector for language detection

can you explain the below to a novice 
Access all endpoints and public models
Up to 100 concurrent requests for Deepgram pre-recorded speech-to-text models, 50 concurrent requests for streaming speech-to-text, and 5 concurrent requests for Deepgram Whisper Cloud
Up to 40 concurrent connections for the WebSocket API and up to 2 concurrent requests (that typically support 480 requests/min, around 120 concurrent conversations) for the batch API for Deepgram Aura text-to-speech. For higher rate limits, fill out this form
Up to 10 concurrent req
I'll explain these Deepgram rate limits in simple terms for a novice:
What Are Rate Limits?
Rate limits are restrictions on how many requests you can make to Deepgram's services at the same time. Think of it like how many people can use a service simultaneously without overloading it.
Deepgram's Rate Limits Explained
Speech-to-Text (Converting spoken words to written text)
Pre-recorded audio: You can send up to 100 audio files at the same time for transcription
Streaming audio: You can have up to 50 live audio streams being transcribed simultaneously
Whisper Cloud model: Limited to only 5 concurrent requests (this is more restricted because it's a slower model)
Text-to-Speech (Converting written text to spoken words)
WebSocket API (for real-time conversations): Up to 40 simultaneous connections
Batch API (for non-real-time needs): Only 2 requests at once, but this typically supports:
About 480 requests per minute
Roughly 120 concurrent conversations
This is because each text-to-speech request takes about 250 milliseconds to complete and is typically needed every 10-20 seconds in a conversation, as explained in a GitHub discussion.
What This Means In Practice
If you're building an application:
For most basic uses, these limits are sufficient
If you hit these limits, your additional requests will receive a "429: Too Many Requests" error
For higher volume needs, Enterprise customers can request increased limits
If you need higher limits for text-to-speech, you can contact Deepgram sales as mentioned in their FAQ.

please explain the below to a novice 
Hi @nithisb, could you please explain more about how the 3 concurrent TTS requests is too low for you, and how many concurrent requests you're looking for?

We set that number because a TTS request takes about 250 ms to complete, and is needed perhaps every 10-20 seconds for a voicebot reply in a 2-party call. So three concurrent requests can support around 120-240 concurrent conversations with a human.
I'll explain this Deepgram text-to-speech (TTS) rate limit concept in simple terms:
What This Text Is About
This is a response from a Deepgram representative explaining why their limit of 3 concurrent TTS requests is actually sufficient for many use cases.
Understanding TTS Request Speed
Request processing time: Each TTS request (converting text to speech) takes about 250 milliseconds (1/4 of a second) to complete
Conversation pattern: In a typical conversation between a human and a voicebot, the bot only needs to speak every 10-20 seconds (when it's the bot's turn to respond)
How This Affects Capacity
Because each TTS request:
Processes quickly (250ms)
Is only needed occasionally (every 10-20 seconds)
This means that 3 concurrent requests can actually support between 120-240 simultaneous conversations with humans.
Simple Math Example
If each conversation needs a new TTS request every 20 seconds
And each request takes 250ms (1/4 second) to process
Then one TTS "slot" can handle 80 different conversations (20 seconds ÷ 0.25 seconds)
With 3 concurrent slots, that's 240 conversations (3 × 80)
This is why Deepgram believes 3 concurrent requests is sufficient for many applications, even though the number might seem small at first glance.
According to GitHub discussions, this is the standard explanation Deepgram provides to users who request higher TTS limits.

https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/articles/14312733311761-How-many-requests-can-I-make-and-can-I-increase-it?utm_source=chatgpt.com , and also do we need eleven labs as its more costly but performance is the best in terms of quality , is there any other solution or this is the best . Makr the architecture above more smoother and less complex which should be easy to scale , maintain w.r.t to cost , security and use .

Make this document in a right flow with tables , diagrams , data so that a non-techincal person can easily understand 



To effectively manage high concurrency, optimize performance, and ensure cost-efficiency for Kickcall.ai—a SaaS and B2B voice agent platform handling inbound and outbound calls via SIP—we propose a streamlined, scalable architecture. This design leverages self-hosted components and enterprise-grade models to deliver real-time, secure, and high-quality voice interactions.
